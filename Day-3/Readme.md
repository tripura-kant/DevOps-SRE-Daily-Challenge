# Day 3 Challenge: Multi-Service Reverse Proxy with Nginx

Hello Learners,

Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

Today, youâ€™ll explore the power of Nginx by setting up a reverse proxy for multiple services. This hands-on challenge
will enhance your skills in configuring secure, efficient, and scalable web accessâ€”an essential skill for any DevOps
professional!

## Requirements:

### Service Setup:

- Install and run Grafana and Jenkins locally or via Docker.

### Nginx Reverse Proxy:

- Configure Nginx to route requests:

```
https://grafana.local â†’ Grafana
https://jenkins.local â†’ Jenkins (with Basic Authentication).
```

### Enable SSL:

- Generate and configure a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS access.
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

### Secure Jenkins:

- Restrict Jenkins/Grafana access with Basic Authentication.

### Validate Configuration:

- Access both services via the configured domains securely using HTTPS.

</br>

## Why This Matters:

Reverse proxies are a cornerstone of cloud-native architectures, enabling secure service exposure, load balancing, and
high availability.
This challenge prepares you to handle real-world scenarios where Nginx is critical.

## Submission Guidelines:

1. GitHub Repository: Upload your Nginx configuration, Grafana and Jenkins setup steps, and screenshots of task
   completion.

2. Documentation: Include a README.md explaining your approach, challenges faced, and key learnings.

3. Share Your Progress: Post your experience with hashtags: #getfitwithsagar, #SRELife, #DevOpsForAll

## Bonus Tasks: </br></br>

### Restrict Access to Jenkins by IP:

- Use Nginxâ€™s allow and deny directives to restrict access to Jenkins from a specific IP range (e.g., your office/home
  IP).
- Only allow access from your designated IP range and deny others.

### Implement Rate Limiting in Nginx:

- Set up Nginx rate limiting to prevent abuse by restricting the number of requests per second from each IP address.
- Ensure that rate limits are applied for access to Jenkins.

### Configure Subdomains:

- Configure Nginx to use subdomains (grafana.local and jenkins.local) instead of path-based routing.

### Automate Setup with  Shell Scripts:

- Write a shell script that automates the entire process:
- Install and configure Grafana and Jenkins.
- Set up Nginx reverse proxy.
- Create and install SSL certificates.
- Configure Basic Authentication for Jenkins.
- The script should handle all the steps required to set up the environment from scratch.
